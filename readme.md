# RE-stall

Set of installation scripts for programs that I often use.

Installing programs on fresh Arch install has never been easier.

## Scripts description

### PHP

- `composer-install.sh` - installs composer globally and sets up PATH variable
- `php-install.sh` - sets up newest php, including settings in `php.ini` and `php-fpm, php-cgi`
- `php-legacy-install.sh` - same as above, but for legacy php version
